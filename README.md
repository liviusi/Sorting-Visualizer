# Sorting Visualizer
This has been written as an exercise to try out OpenGL.

## How does it work?
It uses OpenGL to handle graphics.

## How do I run it?
First of all you need to setup OpenGL and gcc for your operating system; then you can run:

    chmod +x run.sh
    ./run.sh

## Which sorting algorithms have been implemented?
1. [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort). 
2. [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort).
3. [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort).
